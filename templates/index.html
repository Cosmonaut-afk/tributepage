    <p><h2>About XXXTentacion</h2></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy (January 23, 1998 – June 18, 2018), known professionally as XXXTentacion,was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. Despite being a controversial figure due to his widely publicized legal issues, XXXTentacion gained a cult following among his young fanbase during his short career through his depression and alienation-themed music. He was often credited by critics and fans for his musical versatility, with his music exploring emo, trap, lo-fi, indie rock, nu metal, hip hop, R&B and punk rock.</p>
    <p>Born in Plantation, Florida, XXXTentacion spent most of his childhood in Lauderhill. He began writing music after being released from a juvenile detention center and soon started his music career on SoundCloud in 2013, employing styles and techniques that were unconventional in rap music, such as distortion and heavy guitar-backed instrumentals drawing inspiration from third-wave emo and grunge. In 2014, he formed the underground collective Members Only and alongside other members of the collective he soon became a popular figure in SoundCloud rap, a trap music scene that takes elements of lo-fi music and harsh 808s.</p>
    <p>XXXTentacion rose to mainstream attention with the single "Look at Me". His debut album 17 (2017) was certified double platinum in the US. His second album “?” (2018) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and the album's lead single, "Sad!", reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and had amassed more than a billion views on YouTube by January 2021. On June 18, 2018, XXXTentacion was fatally shot at the age of 20, in a robbery at a motorcycle dealership in Deerfield Beach, Florida. The attackers fled the scene in an SUV after stealing from him a Louis Vuitton bag containing $50,000; four suspects were arrested. No trial date has been set for the accused.</p>
    <p>On June 18, 2018, Onfroy was leaving the Riva Motorsports motorcycle dealership in Deerfield Beach, Florida, and, at 3:56 p.m., was blocked from exiting the parking lot by a black Dodge Journey SUV. Two armed men exited the SUV and approached the rapper while he was sitting in the driver's seat. A brief struggle occurred, and the armed men reached inside Onfroy's vehicle, stole a small Louis Vuitton bag containing $50,000, and shot Onfroy multiple times. The shooters fled the scene in their SUV and Onfroy was transported by paramedics to the nearby Broward Health North hospital in Deerfield Beach, where he was pronounced dead.</p>
